## CityRoute-Planner System – C++ Project

A C++ console-based project to simulate a real-world city management system using graph-based data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- Add cities dynamically
- Add roads with distances between cities
- Display full city map (graph)
- Find the **shortest route** between two cities using **Dijkstra's algorithm**
- Suggest an optimal way to connect all cities using **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**

## Technologies Used

- C++
- STL: `vector`, `unordered_map`, `priority_queue`, `string`, etc.
- Graph algorithms: Dijkstra’s & Prim’s
